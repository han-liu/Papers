# Papers

Dear friends, here is the list of papers that I read during my Ph.D. period.

****

Most of the papers are in the field of medical image analysis and computer vision. 

In each summary, I will include the following parts: (1) objective, (2) proposed method,(3) my version and the difference and (4) comments.

Specifically, *my version and the difference* means that after I have a basic idea of the objective and proposed methods by looking at the abstract (without reading the paper in detail), I will write down my version of this paper including (1) how I would develop this method and (2) how I would design my experiments. This is motived by this [[video]](https://v.qq.com/x/page/w3218w6zkcm.html). The goal is to pick up the parts where I think differently from the authors and learn from it.
